The `old_gdip_stuff` folder contains the old `gdip_all.ahk` and examples released by `mmikeww` (guest3456 on AHK forums).

I've also included the `gdip_all.ahk` created by `robodesign`, with many more GDI+ functions and a few more examples.

I have transcribed both these versions for AHK v2 a129.  So I can't take credit for anything here.  Those parts is not my original work.

========================================================================

As for my lib, I have to give special thanks to several individuals whose work has helped me understand GDI/+ to a level where I was able to make my lib what it is now:

mmikeww (guest3456)
robodesign
just me - for his work on MDMF, it's rather crutial for GDI/+

And other users that I know of who contributed to these older libs / examples, as well as answering some questions that let me to this point:

isahound
lexikos

And a special thanks to `robodesign`, who answered the MAJOR bulk of my questions (and there are more to come ;)

========================================================================

Ok, I'll improve the documentation over time.  I just wanted to post this along with the old stuff to finally get it out there.

Just edit the pic_viewer.ahk to point to a pic of your choice (the bigger the better to get the full effect of how fast this is), and run the script.

Then resize the window, and see how smooth it is ;)

I'm working at understanding GDI more so I can implement regions, shapes, brushes, pens, etc.

Sorry for the short (and uninformative) intro.  Most of my efforts have been spent learning GDI.

Complete documentation, as well as more thorough credits, are in order and will happen.

If you want to drop me a line on AHK forums and let me know i missed someone who deserves credit, please do.
